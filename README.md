# Loan Approval Prediction

Loan approval prediction refers to the use of machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a loan application being approved or denied by banks and financial institutions. By using advanced algorithms and predictive models, banks can streamline their loan approval processes and make informed decisions for the benefit of both lenders and borrowers.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to create a predictive model that accurately determines whether a loan application should be approved or denied based on the given loan approval prediction dataset. The dataset includes various details about loan seekers, including their personal and financial information, such as gender, marital status, education level, income, loan amount, loan term, credit history, property size, and loan approval status.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains the following columns:

- `Gender`: Gender of the loan applicant.
- `Married`: Marital status of the applicant.
- `Dependents`: Number of dependents.
- `Education`: Education level of the applicant.
- `Self_Employed`: Whether the applicant is self-employed.
- `Property_Area`: Area where the property is located.
- `Income`: Applicant's income.
- `Loan_Amount`: Amount of the loan requested.
- `Loan_Term`: Term of the loan.
- `Credit_History`: Credit history of the applicant (binary: 1 for good credit, 0 for poor credit).
- `Loan_Status`: The target variable, indicating loan approval (Y/N).

## Analysis Steps

The project involves the following key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: We load the dataset, handle missing data, and explore the data to understand its structure.

2. Feature Engineering: We may perform feature engineering if necessary, such as encoding categorical variables.

3. Model Building: We build machine learning models to predict loan approval based on the dataset.

4. Model Evaluation: We evaluate the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Model Selection: We select the best-performing model for loan approval prediction.

6. Interpretation: We provide insights into the factors that influence loan approval decisions.

## Usage

To run the analysis or reproduce the results, follow the steps outlined in the Jupyter notebooks provided in the `notebooks/` directory. You may need to install required Python libraries using `pip` as mentioned in the notebooks.
